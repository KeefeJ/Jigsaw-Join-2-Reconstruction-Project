# Jigsaw-Join-2-Reconstruction-Project

The goal of this project is to reconstruct the fabulous Jigsaw Join 2 mod by [Anthony Sunkist](https://steamcommunity.com/id/AnthonySunkist) for the Tabletop Simulator.

At the moment only the 16:9 2304pcs board is working, since thats the only board for which I had the model files on my backup drive.

I hope that maybe someone else still has models for some of the other board types...
If you have, please feel free to contact me, or create a pull request.
