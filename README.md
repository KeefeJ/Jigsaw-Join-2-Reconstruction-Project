# Jigsaw-Join-2-Reconstruction-Project

The goal of this project is to reconstruct the fabulous Jigsaw Join 2 mod by [Anthony Sunkist](https://steamcommunity.com/id/AnthonySunkist) for the Tabletop Simulator.

At the moment not all boards from the original mod are working, since I dont have the model files for those boards.

I hope that maybe someone else still has models for some of the missing board types...
If you have, please feel free to contact me, or create a pull request.
